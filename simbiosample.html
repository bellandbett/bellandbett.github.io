<p align="left">OMAR: God... what kind of a task is this? Am I supposed to figure out what we should be doing right now? And then tomorrow, next week... in general? Am I going to be... <em>Are</em> we supposed to be doing something? Are we here to be rather than to do? Would they have gone to so much trouble...</p>
<p>PAWEL (<i>Memorising</i>): Be not do... Be not do... Be not do...</p>
<p>OMAR: All the actual work is being performed by the System... We're kind of like drones...</p>
<p>PAWEL (<i>Daydreaming</i>): Drone... Throne... Overthrown... Around his neck... &quot;Prisoner may speak to one&quot;... &quot;I'd like to see you fine&quot;... Omar, do these words mean something to/ O... O... I shouldn't have said that out loud. I shouldn't have said anything at all. I see that I've upset you. I'm apologising. It isn't that I'm trying to sneak into your thoughts- I promise you. This is nearly impossible to describe- it's more like your thoughts are looking for me. I'm really sorry. What a stupid thing to do. I feel rotten about myself now.</p>
<p>OMAR: No... I suppose this is something that you can't help... That happens to you all the time. In the Section there are times when... things get turned upside-down. There are... ritual killings, I suppose you'd call them. I was ten when my father died... He said something to me... (<i>After some silence</i>) Pawel, I don't believe you've stayed quiet for this long since I met you. Do, please, say what you're thinking and whatever you're sensing. That's surely why you're here. But if you could, as well, bear in mind that I'm not like the kind of people that you're used to.</p>
<p>PAWEL: What's it like being a psychopath?</p>
<p>OMAR: What do you expect to get back with a question like that? I only know what it's like to be myself- of course. And I have spent my entire existence inside the Section. How do I seem to you? To me you seem... like a very strange child. If I think about it- what is it like to be a psychopath? Just the other week I had my own first first-hand experience of the difference- I can tell you about that. In the lead-up to this I had to do some modules in a science lab. I had to be there on my own with thirteen or so normals. Naturally I was in a cubicle where they couldn't see me. Anyway this one day we were doing chemistry. One particular... fool, I have to call her, had been sent to the front to give an oral presentation. She was talking too fast, moving too carelessly. She was worrying whether people liked her instead of being nervous of what she was handling. It had to happen that she spilled a large dose of an extremely corrosive liquid over her hand. I can see the moment frozen- when everyone was realising what was happening: the girl herself- naturally on her face there's shock, pain, horror; but on all the other faces I'm seeing the exact same expression- they all look like all their hands are horribly burning; on the inside of the glass between me and them there's a thin reflection of my own face; it just looks like the face of a person looking at other people's faces... In this life I suppose I've been unhappy more than I've been happy. But there's never been a time when I wished I was any other person rather than myself.</p>
<p>PAWEL: Have I heard right- that all children in the section are inoculated with religion? Why are you laughing?</p>
<p>OMAR: Nothing... <i>stet</i>- let it stand. Yes. In the Section we are all raised with the Clear Truth.</p>
<p>PAWEL: So... You believe in a god?</p>
<p>OMAR: At least.</p>
<p>PAWEL: It doesn't bother you that I'm questioning you about this? There's a look you give me sometimes that positively freezes my blood.</p>
<p>OMAR: Well I'm certainly not going to get exercised over this topic. Continue- and I'll try to regard you at room temperature.</p>
<p>PAWEL: Psychopaths are trained to be religious. Normal people and sensitives are not. What does this fact suggest to you?</p>
<p>OMAR: That our society views the Clear Truth as a useful tool for engineering social harmony- a strait-jacket of discipline for those who require it most.</p>
<p>PAWEL: Aren't those the words of someone doubting what they have been taught to believe?</p>
<p>OMAR: I phrased that as I thought it would suit your understanding. If I was talking to a fellow-believer it would be different.</p>
<p>PAWEL: But are you a believing fellow if you can think and talk this way?</p>
<p>OMAR: Certainly. Let me take one mistake off you: no one- either in our administration or higher up, is stupid enough as to try and deceive us. We have discussions like this one all the time. It doesn't usually lead to... I wrote a school essay along these lines when I was thirteen.</p>
<p>PAWEL: But you are able to see the logical flaws in believing.</p>
<p>OMAR: To that I must say that it's doubt that has the fundamental flaw. Belief is an ideal construct that claims to explain existence. There it is- standing by itself. Doubt is a critique of a preceding theory. But if there is nothing previous for it to lean back on...</p>
<p>PAWEL: You were raised with this belief. I was raised without it. But if I was the psychopath and you were the normal or the sensitive that would be the other way around.</p>
<p>OMAR: What this conversation is revealing, interestingly, is your failure to empathise with me. You're not getting how I view this life and the living of it. I amn't able to live in a pure present but I generally can confine my thinking within the... life segment that I'm in right now. Right now the segment that I'm in is the term of my conscripted service. My father's murder is a different segment- cut off. The future- if I have one, is a different segment. Every one of these segments has problems that need to be decided on. So far I've found belief to be an important tool for... You aren't impressed. The best way I can think of to justify this... I don't suppose you're any good at sport? Imagine anyway that you're about to take a free shot. How do you prepare your mind for this? If you leave it to itself it'll start doing what it's designed to do- foreseeing every possible outcome and making contingency plans for each. But when your mind is doing that your ability to sink the shot is being dissipated. Right up to the moment the ball leaves your fingertips you want your mind to be considering only one possibility. So as you take aim you are informing yourself: &quot;This ball is going in. I never miss.&quot; Once the shot has been launched your mind can go back to entertaining as many theories as it likes. But in the moment when you are dealing with that individual problem you compel it to believe.</p>
<p>PAWEL: You tell yourself a lie and then try really hard to believe this lie.</p>
<p>OMAR: No! Can you truly be this... The point missed again. Of course I couldn't try to believe something that I know is not true. In my metaphor- if not on the court, I never have missed. As I'm taking that shot therefore I can say to myself <em>and</em> believe: &quot;I am not capable of missing.&quot; If I then do see my ball bouncing off the rim... I'm going to have to make a serious adjustment to my mindset.</p>
<h1 align="center">Owl Robot- extract</h1>
<p align="left">(<i>The robot is approaching Plake carrying a cup of tea</i>)</p>
<p>PLAKE: No- fuck you! If I had wanted a cup of tea I would have said: &quot;Bring me a cup of tea.&quot; And now I would be saying: &quot;Thank you, robot, for bringing me this cup of tea I asked for.&quot; What I did say was: &quot;Bring me the drink.&quot; And now I'm saying: &quot;Throw that piss away and bring me the fucking drink, like I told you in the first place!&quot;</p>
<p>ROBOT: Mr Plake, I don't understand you. When you said earlier that the water here isn't strong enough- I didn't understand that either.</p>
<p>PLAKE: I can see that I'm going to be spending too much time spelling everything out for you: Robot, bring me the Polish vodka. Do not bring me a glass.</p>
<p>ROBOT: Mr Plake, I'm afraid there is not the Polish vodka here for me to bring you.</p>
<p>PLAKE: What? How isn't there? Wasn't that part of the list? Didn't... yes! I definitely did tell you to bring me some Polish vodka. Did you forget? Wasn't I saying you should have written the things down?</p>
<p>ROBOT: Mr Plake, I'm afraid I wasn't able to buy Polish vodka.</p>
<p>PLAKE: O Jesus Christ... Is this some... Robot, will you please go out again and buy me a bottle of &quot;Ziemniaki Wodka&quot;.</p>
<p>ROBOT: I regret that I cannot, Mr Plake.</p>
<p>PLAKE: What? Is this some kind of Bertrand Russell caper? Robot, can you buy me some <em>Russian</em> vodka? Robot, can you buy me <em>any</em> vodka?</p>
<p>ROBOT: I regret that I cannot, Mr Plake.</p>
<p>PLAKE: &quot;Em emem em Em emem.&quot; Why not?</p>
<p>ROBOT: I am not authorised to buy alcohol.</p>
<p>PLAKE: For <em>fuck</em>... And why didn't you say this at the time? When we were making out that list why didn't you tell me so then? When I said- &quot;and a bottle of Polish vodka&quot;, why didn't you say: &quot;Mo Rhys, I regret that I am unable to fulfil this request&quot;? (<i>Robotic silence</i>) Well? Why didn't you say that or something like it? (<i>Even more silent</i>) Did that bitch tell you to keep me from drinking? (<i>Robot definitely taking the 5<sup>th</sup></i>) Ah- ha... I'm beginning to see where the goat eats its grass. So you're able to tell me lies when it suits, little robot?</p>
<p>ROBOT: I have not told you a lie, Mr Plake.</p>
<p>PLAKE: Well aren't you the clockwork sophist! You're quite right- you didn't tell me any lies... You just made full sure not to tell me the truth. Well now, well now... I can see that this is going to develop into a game of chess or- &quot;<i>Go</i>&quot;? But I am going to win! I'll have to spend a day or two studying the no-man's land and marshalling my forces. In the meantime you can bring me over that bottle of Saskatchewan- I didn't like it but I might as well finish it off... Hi... Where's that bottle gone? Wasn't that there on the sink a minute ago- or yesterday? That was nearly full! By Christ- robot! If you're after pouring that drink down the sink...</p>
<p>ROBOT: I have locked the alcohol inside the medication safe, Mr Plake. The nurse must have overlooked it. She will want to take charge of it at her next scheduled visit.</p>
<p>PLAKE: Will- she- fuck! She won't get a foot inside that door! What made me ever draw these fuckers onto myself? Wasn't I grand as I was? But things are going to be put back into the box. Bring the bottle here.</p>
<p>ROBOT: What bottle do you wish me to bring?</p>
<p>PLAKE: O, brilliant side-step! Is this going to be the level of it? Will you stop... Robot, bring me the bottle of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>ROBOT: Mr Plake, the bottle of Saskatchewan is locked inside the medication safe.</p>
<p>PLAKE: For... Are you hoping that if you keep stalling me I might get bored, fall asleep, forget all about it? Yes, indeed... we know- we have learned that the bottle of Saskatchewan is now immured within this new medicine locker. We further know that it is in there because you- robot, locked it inside there. Applying half of our logic to these two givens we can conclude that you- robot, have the means firstly of opening and lastly of closing this miniature dungeon. Therefore- robot, I impart to you the following command, robot: &quot;Robot, unlock this receptacle; robot, remove from it the bottle of Saskatchewan that you- robot, secreted there previously; bring the named bottle to me, robot; place it between my hands, robot; here ends the command, robot,&quot; robot.</p>
<p>ROBOT: I must respectfully decline to do as you ask.</p>
<p>PLAKE (_____): You- fucking- tin- arsehole! Bring me my drink!</p>
<p>ROBOT: I regret that I must decline to obey.</p>
<p>PLAKE: I don't fucking believe this. This is my own property- I paid for it. Bring it fucking here!</p>
<p>ROBOT: I must res-</p>
<p>PLAKE: Give me the key! Hand me the key and step the fuck back.</p>
<p>ROBOT: Mr Plake, I am unable to comply. (<i>Plake has worked himself around so that he can give the robot the stare-of-death out of both eyeballs</i>)</p>
<p>PLAKE: Robot... Give- me- that- key.</p>
<p>ROBOT: Mr Plake, I am unable to fulfil this request. (<i>Plake has armed himself with a newspaper</i>)</p>
<p>PLAKE: You unalloyed... Be very sure of one thing- I'm going to drink every last drop of that bottle of Saskatchewan. Robot... open this locker. (<i>The robot is outwardly submissive but holding firm to its purpose. Plake thwacks it</i>) Give me the key! (<i>The command and the stimulus are repeated several times but the robot maintains its passive resistance.</i>)</p>
