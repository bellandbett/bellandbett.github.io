<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">An Expedition to the Most Remote and Inhospitable Part of Groenland</H1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I>extract</I></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">PAT: I know damn well he will because that's where he's going to stay- here at home. John, you're staying here, do you hear me? You will not go off on this fool of a journey. I will not allow it. (<I>She waits as if for an answer. Harris continues to look at her dully. Awkward pause</I>) I... I know what that look means. You're thinking that if you want to go then you'll go and there's nothing I can do to stop you. Is that what you mean to say?</P>
<P>HARRIS: Yes. (<I>Rush is about to speak but Harris goes on speaking his thoughts</I>) How did she do that? (<I>He turns away from them towards the front again</I>) That was what I meant to say. As soon as I heard the words I recognised that it was what was in my head. It was exactly what I should have said. I was trying to think of it but I couldn't. How did she know what I wanted to say before I did? Is she able to read my mind? There's something very wrong here. (<I>Looking out the window again</I>) That old ash is standing there the same as always. And a cat called Rose is sleeping under it as always. Do you know, Rush- every cat of whatever sex that there has ever been on this farm has always had the name Rose. (<I>The lights go out onstage</I>) O! It's gone dark.</P>
<P>RUSH: em... It must be a power-cut.</P>
<P>PAT: Yes, it's a power-cut. John, would you come... come outside with me? I'll need your help. You're the only one who can work that circuit breaker... ah generator.</P>
<P>HARRIS: I... don't...</P>
<P>RUSH (<I>talking loudly as he comes to the front</I>): Are you worried about stumbling in this pitch darkness, Professor? Don't worry. I'll come along and help you. I have night-vision like a cat. I suppose it's because I eat carrots like they were bananas. Ah, there you are! Off we go!</P>
<P>HARRIS: I don't... know... this.</P>
<P>RUSH: Yes, the darkness can be frightfully disorientating, can't it? Just stick by me and step carefully. Where's the doorway? There it is- out you go, Professor.</P>
<P><I>There is the sound of a short struggle and Harris gives a cry of pain. After about a minute the light comes back on. Pat and Rush are standing to one side where she is quietly telling him something. Pen, still holding her roller-skates, is sitting on the couch beside another man wearing the jacket Harris had on. Pat and Rush finish their conversation and come over and stand in front of this other man.</I></P>
<P>PAT: John, I've been telling the whole story to young Robert.</P>
<P>RUSH: I'm afraid, Professor, that what I have heard, does indeed change everything. It was completely irresponsible and wrong of you to hide from me how ill you are. There can be no question now-</P>
<P><I>Professor John interrupts him by getting down on the ground and doing some fast push-ups. Then he jumps to his feet and holds his wrist out to Rush to have his pulse taken.</I></P>
<P>PROFESSOR JOHN: Not <EM>am</EM>, Rush, <EM>was</EM>. I <EM>was</EM> sick and I have recovered. That was something in the past. To me it's almost like the person who had that episode, that single episode, was not me but someone else... a different person.</P>
<P>RUSH: But you are the same person, professor. And this episode, as you call it, was not indigestion but heart failure. You know very well that this changes things completely- why else did you try to conceal this information from me? Professor, out there we would be hundreds of difficult miles from all assistance. You were insane to even consider such a risk. You have deceived me and you have wasted my time. The expedition is off.</P>
<P>PROFESSOR JOHN: Well, damn you then! You'll side with her just like everyone else does, will you? You can go and get stuffed then! You probably wouldn't have been any use anyway- couldn't even get off a country train without falling on both sides of your arse and losing all our equipment. Go on then. I'll do it without you. I'll find someone else.</P>
<P><I>Pen, holding her roller-skates, steps in between the two parties. She is opening her mouth to say something when Harris staggers onstage as if breaking away from someone.</I></P>
<P>HARRIS: I have to go on an expedition to the most remote and inhospitable part of Groenland! (<I>He stops and looks around, confused and tired. He touches his scalp</I>) My head hurts. (<I>Grimacing he comes towards the others. Seeing Rush he suddenly gets angry</I>) Well, damn you then! You'll side with her just like everyone else does, will you? You can go and get stuffed then! You probably wouldn't have been any use anyway- couldn't even get off a country train without falling on both sides of your arse and losing all our equipment. Go on then. I'll do it without you. I'll find someone else. (<I>Confused again he looks around and notices Professor John</I>) Who're you? You weren't here... before. Isn't that my jacket?</P>
<P>PROFESSOR JOHN: I'm... I'm... (<I>Suddenly brightening he reaches out and grabs hold of both Harris's wrists</I>) I'm your brother!</P>
<P><I>Harris frees himself and draws back from him.</I></P>
<P>HARRIS: My brother? I don't have a brother. I don't even know you. I've never set eyes on you before. (<I>Thinking</I>) Do I have a brother? I didn't think I did. (<I>Aloud</I>) What's your name?</P>
<P>PROFESSOR JOHN: My name is... (<I>Reluctantly</I>) John.</P>
<P>HARRIS: But that's... that's my name! I'm John Harris. If you're my brother how can your name be John as well?</P>
<P>PROFESSOR JOHN (<I>laughing nervously</I>): Well... John... that's a long story... and it's a strange story... and it's a sad story. You see, John, it was this way... This is a little strange- with a name like John I should be used to addressing other people by my own name. But with you it's different- it's like we're twins, kind of, or two different versions of the same person... Anyway... John, this is the explanation, this is the way it was: I know I don't look it but I'm two years older than you are. I was our parents' first child. And I was the apple of their eye- of both their eyes. During those first months of my life my parents- our parents were employing an old lady from ah... Tanganika, as a child-minder. Her name was Ka- lu- lu. Anyhow this old lady from Tanganika, Kalulu, developed a deranged affection for me. She began to confuse me with a son she had herself lost when she was younger. Finally one day she cracked up entirely. She stole the child, that is me, out of the cot and disappeared with me. I was about one year old at this time. Of course my parents- our parents were beside themselves with grief. Or rather worry. They searched for me high and low. But for a finish they resigned themselves to the belief that I was dead. Then a year later when you were born- I suppose it was their way of trying to keep something of me alive although of course I was in fact alive, they gave you the same name as I had had: John. They never told you about me- it was just too upsetting for them, the poor devils, and you grew up thinking you were an only child. Meanwhile the old lady, Kulala had taken me back to Tanganika with her. And... ah... that's where I've been ever since. Kululu concealed my true identity from me and raised me as her own child. Em... she explained away my pale skin to me by saying that I'd had a bad dose of jaundice as a child. It was only a month ago when she was on her deathbed- em... she lived to be an incredible age, that she confessed the whole story to me. So I left everything then and there and made my way back here as fast as I could to meet my true family. It took me this long because I'd no money and I had to thumb it. I was for ever coming up through France- they're mean bastards to give anyone a lift. Now... John, here's where the fantastic coincidences mount up... You see I'm a professor of science just like you. So when I arrived here and heard how you mightn't be able to undertake your expedition to Groenland I volunteered straightaway to go in your place. Now it's just after coming out about me having a dickey heart just like you do. And now the conscientious Mr Rush and your lady wife were being a bit cross with me- just like they were with you.</P>
<P>HARRIS (<I>speaking thoughts</I>): There was a power cut... We were going out... I don't remember being outside... again. O God, my head really hurts. Why does it hurt so much? A lot seems to have happened. How much time has gone by? Where have I been?</P>
<P>PROFESSOR JOHN: Then again, John, if you consider it- it isn't so amazing as all that. All those coincidences aren't all that- em- unbelievable. Sure if you think about it, aren't we brothers? Isn't there that connection between us? So it isn't that amazing that we should both have gone into the same line of study. And then it would explain as well why we both have a similar medical condition.</P>
<P>HARRIS: You speak English very well.</P>
<P>PROFESSOR JOHN: O, the language... yes... em... We have a radio- BBC world service... Anyway, John... no need to worry about those things... now that you're here- now that you're feeling better... (<I>He begins to back away slowly</I>) Sure, ye won't be needing me. I'd... ah... I'd better go.</P>
<P>HARRIS: But... John... You're only after coming... aren't you? You've only just found me... We've only just met.</P>
<P>PROFESSOR JOHN (<I>hurrying to the exit</I>): Yes, John, I know... But I can't stay. I positively have to go... I need to go... ah... back to Africa.</P>
<P><I>He goes off. Frowning with thought Harris wanders towards the front of the stage. He seems to look out the window again.</I></P>
<P>HARRIS: That old ash is standing there the same as always. And a cat called Rose is sleeping under it as always. Do you know, Rush- every cat of whatever sex that there has ever been on this farm has always had the name Rose. (<I>Speaking thoughts</I>) God... I have a brother. All this time I've had an older brother and I never knew about him. Why did my parents- our parents never tell me about him? How could they have given up on him like that- so easily? My parents- God, I can't remember their faces. Has it been so long since I've seen them? God, I have a brother. This is marvellous! And we have so much in common: first we're both called John; and then he's a professor... of science just like me. And languages- well I suppose he must speak... whatever they speak in Tanganika anyway. I wonder does he speak a whole bookcase full of them like I do? But... but he's gone away again! He's on his way back to Tanganika and he hasn't even left me an address. All our lives I haven't known him but now I feel terribly alone without him.</P>
<P><I>Rush comes forward and touches Harris's elbow.</I></P>
